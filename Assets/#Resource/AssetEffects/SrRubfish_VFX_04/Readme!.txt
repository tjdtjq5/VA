Hello!
Thanks for adquiring my fourth pack. Pulling this out has been a hard work, and it's my first time adding some work using VFX Graph. Even when right now I don't consider like it displaces Shuriken, I find it super useful.

This pack includes 50 flipbooks, 65 prefabs (including variances of many effects, to suit different needs out of the box) and some basic shaders made in shader graph, so if you wanna modify then for to better suit your needs, that's a posibility.

This means that you need BOTH VFX GRAPH AND SHADER GRAPH in order to be able to use 100% of the power of this pack. 

Unity version: 2021.3+

There are some elements I think they're worth to document(for Unity users):

- Shaders are made in ShaderGraph, you can download it for free and play with the shaders just connecting nodes without writting a single code line.
- Shaders are compatible with URP mainly. But they have support for BuiltIn or HDRP, you could need to adjust the blending for those (Set the material to transparent). This also applies to only the effects using VFX Graph.

Have fun, and, if you love it, please leave a review.

At any problem, mail me at srtorubfish@gmail.com (Please, for bugs add a screenshot and some information, it's super hard to fix issues as a single person without proper data, thanks!)
